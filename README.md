# Algoritmo-Gen√©tico

## About

In this repository, there is an NP-hard solved called max diversity. It was solved using a genetic Algorithm.

### The Problem
It tries to find the maximum diversity between the objects inside the comparison area. The entry base numbers from 0 to 500, all of which float numbers. The algorithm should ideally return 0 or 500. However, we can ask it to produce more numbers, like 6 or 10. But it;'s unnecessary since there is only one level.
